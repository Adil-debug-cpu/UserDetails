UserCard

This is a React functional component that renders a user card. It takes in props such as userId, avatar, login, and contributions to display relevant user data.

It uses the Link component from react-router-dom to link to a specific user's detail page based on the userId prop.

The component then returns a list item with an image container and an information container, which displays the user's login and contributions.
